                        <h5>Research Interests</h5>
                        <p>I am a Master student working on my thesis project in the Amsterdam Emotional Memory Group in collaboration with my home university, the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, Germany. The project focusses on whether the emotionality of episodic memories can be changed using an experimental design and psychophysiological measures such as fEMG and is supervised by <a href="Vanessa.html">Vanessa van Ast</a> and <a href="Sascha.html">Sascha Duken</a>. 

                        Besides memory distortions in affective disorders (such as depression and anxiety disorders) and ways of treating them, I am also interested in research on imaginary rescripting as well as on the development of new, low-threshold intervention programmes especially for refugees.</p>


                        <h5>Background</h5>
                        <p>After completing my Bachelor of Science in Psychology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich (2016) I continued my Master´s in Clinical Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. Besides my studies, I was working at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry as a student assistant (May 2016 – February 2018) and did voluntary work as a counsellor at a German helpline for children and teenagers (“Nummer gegen Kummer”, February 2016 – February 2018). During the second year of my Master´s, I joined the Amsterdam Emotional Memory Group for a three month internship (March – June 2018). It has been a great experience, so I decided to expand my stay for another nine months (October 2018 – July 2019) to do my Master thesis project at the UvA. My stays in Amsterdam were gratefully supported by scholarships of the Max Weber-Programme and PROSA LMU.</p>
